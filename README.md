# Model-For-Source-Data

This repository contains a draft of an IVOA note.

This note proposes a possible way to make source data interoperable. 
It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in term of both format and usage. 
Both data annotation and annotated data parsing processes are also considered.

This is a temporary repository for the version 0. The project will be moved later to an ivoa repository including all necessary stuff to build a standard. -- Sept 2019 --
